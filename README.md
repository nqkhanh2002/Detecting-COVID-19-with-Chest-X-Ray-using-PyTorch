## About The Project
In this hands-on project, I will train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by media companies to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not. The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of news-related articles.

##  Dataset
Dataset from [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

**Inspiration** <br>
Can you use this data set to make an algorithm able to determine if an article is fake news or not ?

## Objectives
1. Understand the problem statement and business case  

2. Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing

3. Perform Exploratory data analysis

4. Perform data cleaning

5. Visualize datasets

6. Prepare the data by performing tokenization and padding

7. Understand the intuition behind recurrent neural networks

8. Understand the intuition behind LSTMs

9. Train an LSTM Model

10. Assess/evaluate trained model performance

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
